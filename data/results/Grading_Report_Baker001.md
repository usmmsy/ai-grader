## Detailed Breakdown

### Question 1
**Score:** 10.0 / 10.0

**Reasoning:**
The student correctly applied mathematical induction to prove the given formula for the sum of cubes. The base case, inductive hypothesis, and inductive step were all correctly executed and logically sound.

**Feedback:**
Excellent work on applying the principle of mathematical induction. Your steps were clear and well-justified.

### Question 3
**Score:** 5.0 / 10.0

**Reasoning:**
The student provided the base case and inductive hypothesis but did not fully elaborate on the inductive step. The inductive step is crucial for completing the proof, and without it, the proof is incomplete.

**Feedback:**
You've made a good start with the base case and inductive hypothesis. However, the inductive step needs to be detailed to complete the proof. Please ensure to elaborate on how the assumption for 'n=k' leads to the conclusion for 'n=k+1'.

### Question 4
**Score:** 0.0 / 10.0

**Reasoning:**
The student has not provided any work for this question beyond stating the base case, inductive hypothesis, and inductive step without any calculations or explanations.

**Feedback:**
It appears you've outlined the structure of a proof by induction but did not include any of the necessary calculations or justifications. Remember, each step needs to be substantiated with mathematical reasoning.

### Question 5
**Score:** 0.0 / 10.0

**Reasoning:**
The student has not provided any work for this question. Without any calculations, explanations, or even the beginning of an attempt, it's impossible to award any points.

**Feedback:**
There is no work shown for this question. To tackle proofs like this, start with the base case, then use the inductive hypothesis to show the statement holds for the next integer. Please review the principles of mathematical induction.
