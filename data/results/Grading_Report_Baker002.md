## General Comments
Overall, you've shown a good understanding of mathematical induction. Your proof for the sum of cubes was particularly well done. For the other questions, focusing on providing more detailed steps and explanations, especially for the inductive steps, will help improve your proofs. Keep working on elaborating your reasoning and ensuring each step of your proof is clear and justified.

## Detailed Breakdown

### Question 1
**Score:** 10.0 / 10.0

**Reasoning:**
The student correctly applied mathematical induction to prove the given formula for the sum of cubes. The base case, inductive hypothesis, and inductive step were all correctly executed and logically sound.

**Feedback:**
Excellent work on the mathematical induction proof. Your steps were clear and correctly demonstrated the validity of the formula.

### Question 3
**Score:** 5.0 / 10.0

**Reasoning:**
The student provided the base case and inductive hypothesis correctly but did not fully elaborate on the inductive step. The transition from the inductive hypothesis to the inductive step lacks detail and explanation on how the formula applies to the case of n=k+1.

**Feedback:**
You've made a good start with the base case and inductive hypothesis. However, the inductive step needs more detailed explanation and demonstration on how it extends the hypothesis to n=k+1.

### Question 4
**Score:** 0.0 / 10.0

**Reasoning:**
The student did not provide any details or steps for the proof regarding divisibility by 6. Without the inductive step or any form of proof, it's impossible to assess the correctness of the claim.

**Feedback:**
Your submission is missing the proof for the divisibility by 6. Remember to include both the inductive step and a detailed explanation of your reasoning.

---

### Question 5
**Score:** 7.0 / 10.0

**Reasoning:**
The student correctly identified the base case and assumed the inductive hypothesis correctly. However, the inductive step is not fully detailed. While the direction is correct, the explanation lacks the mathematical rigor needed to conclusively show the inequality holds for n=k+1.

**Feedback:**
You've done well with the base case and the hypothesis. For the inductive step, try to include more detailed calculations and explanations to strengthen your proof.
